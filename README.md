This application is a question scoring system.

A **question scoring system** is a technique or procedure used to ascertain the group's desire to propose a solution to a specific problem or topic. This might entail voting on a proposal or decision, with each member casting a vote for or against the solution. Afterward, the votes are tabulated, and the winner is selected based on the majority vote.

This is an electronic **scoring** system in which votes are cast and counted electronically instead of on paper ballots. It is used to increase the speed and accuracy of the voting process and to guarantee the results are visible and verifiable.
